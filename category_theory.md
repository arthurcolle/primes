# Category-Theoretic Foundations of S(N,K)

## 1. Monoidal Categories of Factorizations

### The Prime Factorization Category $\mathcal{F}$

Define $\mathcal{F}$ as the strict monoidal category where:
- Objects are natural numbers $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- Morphisms $f: m \to n$ exist when $m | n$
- Composition is given by divisibility transitivity
- Monoidal product is multiplication: $m \otimes n = m \cdot n$
- Monoidal unit is $1$

This forms a symmetric monoidal category with symmetry isomorphism $\sigma_{m,n}: m \otimes n \to n \otimes m$ given by commutativity of multiplication.

### The S(N,K) Subcategory

Define $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}$ as the full subcategory of $\mathcal{F}$ generated by objects in S(N,K). This yields:

$$\mathcal{F}_{N,K} = \langle S(N,K), |, \circ, \otimes, 1, \sigma \rangle$$

The coherence conditions yield a pentagon diagram:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
((a \otimes b) \otimes c) \otimes d & \xrightarrow{\alpha_{a,b,c} \otimes 1_d} & (a \otimes (b \otimes c)) \otimes d \\
\downarrow \alpha_{a\otimes b,c,d} & & \downarrow \alpha_{a,b\otimes c,d} \\
(a \otimes b) \otimes (c \otimes d) & & a \otimes ((b \otimes c) \otimes d) \\
\downarrow \alpha_{a,b,c\otimes d} & & \uparrow 1_a \otimes \alpha_{b,c,d} \\
a \otimes (b \otimes (c \otimes d)) & \underset{=}{\longrightarrow} & a \otimes (b \otimes (c \otimes d))
\end{array}
$$

Which commutes automatically due to associativity of multiplication.

## 2. Topos-Theoretic Structure

### Subobject Classifier in the Topos of S(N,K)

The category of presheaves $[\mathcal{F}_{N,K}^{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ forms an elementary topos. The subobject classifier $\Omega$ is given by:

$$\Omega(n) = \{S \subseteq \{d \in \mathbb{N} | d|n, d \in S(N,K)\}\}$$

Representing all possible subfactorizations within S(N,K).

### Geometric Morphisms Between Parameter Spaces

For $(N,K) \subseteq (N',K')$, there is a geometric morphism:

$$f: \mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{F}_{N,K}) \to \mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{F}_{N',K'})$$

With direct image $f_*$ and inverse image $f^*$ functors satisfying:
- $f^* \dashv f_*$ (adjunction)
- $f^*$ preserves finite limits

This induces a classifying topos for the theory of S(N,K)-factorizations.

## 3. Higher Categorical Structures

### ∞-Category of Factorization Spaces

Construct the ∞-category $\mathcal{S}$ where:
- Objects are pairs $(N,K)$ defining S(N,K) spaces
- 1-morphisms are inclusion maps between parameter spaces
- Higher morphisms encode homotopies between factorization paths

The resulting structure is a complete Segal space satisfying:
- Completeness: equivalences are fully determined by identifications on objects
- Segal condition: composition is uniquely determined up to coherent homotopy

### Factorization Homology

Define factorization homology for S(N,K):

$$\int_{S(N,K)} A = \int_{n \in S(N,K)} A^{\otimes \text{factors}(n)}$$

For an E₂-algebra A, yielding invariants that detect the distributional properties of factorizations.

## 4. Categorical Logic and Type Theory

### Dependent Type Theory for Factorization

Develop a dependent type system where:
- $\mathbb{N}$ is a base type
- $\mathbb{P}_d$ is the type of primes of digit-length $d$
- $S(N,K)$ is a dependent sum type:
  
  $$S(N,K) \equiv \sum_{m:1..N} \sum_{(p_1, \ldots, p_m): \prod_{i=1}^m \sum_{d \in K} \mathbb{P}_d} \prod_{i=1}^m p_i$$

### Homotopy Type Theory Interpretation

In the framework of HoTT:
- $S(N,K)$ becomes a higher inductive type
- Factorization uniqueness is encoded as a path constructor
- Univalence principle enables transport of factorization properties along equivalences

The fundamental groupoid $\Pi_1(S(N,K))$ encodes the web of factorization relationships.

## 5. Enriched Category Theory

### Metric Enrichment

Define a metric enriched category $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}^{met}$ where:
- Hom-sets are enriched over the category of metric spaces
- $d(f,g)$ for morphisms $f,g: m \to n$ measures factorization distance
- The metric is given by:
  
  $$d(f,g) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{p|n} |\text{ord}_p(f) - \text{ord}_p(g)|$$

### Probabilistic Enrichment

Construct $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}^{prob}$ enriched over the category of probability spaces:
- Hom-objects $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}^{prob}(m,n)$ are probability distributions over possible factorization paths
- Composition is given by convolution of distributions
- The monoidal structure uses the pushforward of distributions under multiplication

## 6. 2-Categorical Structure

### The 2-Category $\mathbf{Fact}$

Define $\mathbf{Fact}$ with:
- 0-cells are parameter pairs $(N,K)$
- 1-cells $F: (N,K) \to (N',K')$ are functors between factorization categories
- 2-cells $\alpha: F \Rightarrow G$ are natural transformations between functors

This yields a cartesian closed 2-category with internal hom objects:

$$[(N,K), (N',K')] = (N \cdot N', K \cup K')$$

### Bicategorical Limits and Colimits

The bicategory of factorization systems admits:
- Bilimits representing intersections of factorization constraints
- Bicolimits representing unions of factorization spaces
- Weighted bilimits capturing more complex combinations of constraints

## 7. Operadic and Multicategory Perspectives

### Factorization Operad

Define the colored operad $\mathcal{O}_{N,K}$ where:
- Colors are digit classes $d \in K$
- Operations $\mathcal{O}_{N,K}(d_1, \ldots, d_n; d)$ represent ways to combine primes of classes $d_1, \ldots, d_n$ to form a number with factorization class $d$
- Composition encodes nested factorization structures

The resulting operad is a $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-operad due to commutativity of multiplication.

### Factorization Multicategory

Construct a symmetric multicategory $\mathcal{M}_{N,K}$ where:
- Objects are primes $p \in \bigcup_{d \in K} \mathbb{P}_d$
- Multimorphisms $\mu: (p_1, \ldots, p_m) \to n$ exist when $n = \prod_{i=1}^m p_i$ and $m \leq N$
- Symmetry maps permute the input primes

This provides a representation-theoretic framework for analyzing factorization patterns.

## 8. Categorical Dynamics

### Dynamical Systems on Category $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}$

Define an endofunctor $T_p: \mathcal{F}_{N,K} \to \mathcal{F}_{N,K}$ for $p \in \mathbb{P}_d, d \in K$ by:
- On objects: $T_p(n) = p \cdot n$ (if result in S(N,K), otherwise undefined)
- On morphisms: $T_p(f: m \to n) = pf: pm \to pn$

The resulting categorical dynamical system $(F_{N,K}, \{T_p\}_{p \in \mathbb{P}})$ exhibits:
- Fixed points corresponding to idempotent factorization structures
- Periodic orbits representing cyclic factorization patterns
- Categorical entropy measuring complexity of the action

### Categorical Flow and Persistence

Define the persistence category $\mathcal{P}_{N,K}$ where:
- Objects are nested families of subsets of S(N,K) filters
- Morphisms are inclusion maps
- Functors $F_t$ capture thresholded factorization classes

This induces a persistent homology framework for analyzing the evolution of factorization structures across parameter spaces.

## 9. Grothendieck Fibrations

### The Factorization Fibration

Construct a Grothendieck fibration $\pi: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ where:
- Base category $\mathcal{B}$ has objects $(N,K)$ and morphisms are inclusions
- Total category $\mathcal{E}$ has objects $(n, (N,K))$ where $n \in S(N,K)$
- The fiber $\pi^{-1}(N,K)$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}$

The cleavage gives cartesian lift functors:
$$\phi_{(N,K) \leq (N',K')}: \mathcal{F}_{N,K} \to \mathcal{F}_{N',K'}$$

### Indexed Categories and Factorization

Define the indexed category $\mathcal{F}_{(-,-)}$ over the category of parameter pairs:
- Each $(N,K)$ maps to the category $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}$
- Inclusion maps $(N,K) \subseteq (N',K')$ induce restriction functors

The resulting pseudofunctor is representable by a bigroupoid whose objects are factorizations with controlled signature.

## 10. Sheaf-Theoretic Interpretation

### Factorization Site

Define a Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{F}_{N,K}$ where covering families are collections of divisors whose product equals the target:

$$\{d_i \to n\}_{i \in I} \text{ is a covering if } \prod_{i \in I} d_i = n \text{ and } |I| \leq N$$

### Sheaves of Factorizations

Define the sheaf category $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{F}_{N,K})$ where:
- Objects are sheaves $F: \mathcal{F}_{N,K}^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ satisfying the sheaf condition
- The descent condition encodes factorization uniqueness
- The terminal object represents complete factorization knowledge

For a given signature $\omega$, define the signature sheaf:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\omega}(n) = \begin{cases} 
* & \text{if } n \text{ has signature } \omega \\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

The resulting topos $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{F}_{N,K})$ is the classifying topos for the theory of S(N,K)-factorizations.
