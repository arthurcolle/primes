# Novel Extensions to the Digit-Class Prime Product Framework

## 1. Multivariate Extensions: Vector-Valued κ

### Composite Classification Metrics

Instead of classifying primes by a single attribute (digit length), we can use multiple attributes simultaneously:

$$\vec{\kappa}(p) = (\kappa_1(p), \kappa_2(p), \ldots, \kappa_r(p))$$

Where each $\kappa_i$ represents a different classification metric:

- **Digit Pattern**: $\kappa_{\text{pattern}}(p)$ classifies by digit pattern (e.g., palindromic, repunit)
- **Arithmetic Properties**: $\kappa_{\text{form}}(p)$ classifies by special forms (e.g., Mersenne, Fermat)
- **Spectral Properties**: $\kappa_{\text{spec}}(p)$ classifies by properties in modular arithmetic
- **Density Class**: $\kappa_{\text{dens}}(p)$ classifies by local density of primes in that range

This creates a more nuanced $S(N, \vec{K})$ where $\vec{K} = (K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_r)$ and:

$$S(N, \vec{K}) = \{n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n = \prod_{j=1}^{m \leq N} p_j, \vec{\kappa}(p_j) \in \vec{K}\}$$

### Multi-Signature Analysis

The corresponding multi-signature becomes a tensor:

$$\omega_{\vec{K}}(n) = (c_{\vec{d}})_{\vec{d} \in \vec{K}}$$

Where $c_{\vec{d}}$ counts primes $p_j$ with $\vec{\kappa}(p_j) = \vec{d}$.

This enables:
- Higher-dimensional lattice structure analysis
- Richer correlation studies between different prime attributes
- More nuanced challenge generation for AI systems

## 2. Dynamic Constraint Systems

### Constraint Graphs on Prime Factors

Extend beyond simple count and class restrictions to relational constraints:

$$S_{\Phi}(N,K) = \{n \in S(N,K) \mid \Phi(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m) \text{ holds}\}$$

Examples of constraints $\Phi$:
- Sequential gaps: $|p_{i+1} - p_i| \leq g$ for some bound $g$
- Modular conditions: $p_i \equiv a_i \pmod{m}$
- Combinatorial constraints: no more than $k$ factors from any single digit class
- Derivative constraints: the derivative of the product polynomial satisfies certain properties

### Adaptive Constraint Learning

An AI system can be evaluated on its ability to:
1. Identify hidden constraints from examples
2. Generate new examples satisfying those constraints
3. Explain the constraint system in natural language

## 3. Topological View: Factor Networks

### Prime-Composite Incidence Graphs

Represent the relationship between composites and their prime factors as a bipartite graph:
- Left vertices: composites $n \in S(N,K)$
- Right vertices: primes $p \in \bigcup_{d \in K} \mathbb{P}_d$
- Edges: $(n,p)$ if $p$ divides $n$

This allows analysis of:
- Connectivity properties of S(N,K)
- Community structure among related factorizations
- Path length as a measure of factorization difficulty

### Simplicial Complexes

For each $\omega$-signature, define a simplicial complex:
- Vertices: primes $p$ with $\kappa(p) \in K$
- Simplices: sets of primes whose product is in $S(N,K)$ with signature $\omega$

This enables:
- Homological analysis of the factor space
- Persistent homology to track evolution across parameter changes
- Topological data analysis of factorization patterns

## 4. Information-Theoretic Framework

### Factorization Entropy

Define the factorization entropy of $n \in S(N,K)$ as:

$$H_{\text{fact}}(n) = -\sum_{p|n} \frac{\log p}{\log n} \log_2 \frac{\log p}{\log n}$$

This measures how "evenly distributed" the prime factors are in terms of their contribution to $n$.

### Minimum Description Length Perspective

View factorization as a compression problem:
- The "code length" for $n$ is $\log_2 n$ bits
- The "compressed representation" is $\sum_{p|n} \log_2 p$ bits plus overhead
- The factorization efficiency is the compression ratio

This perspective connects to:
- Kolmogorov complexity of integers
- Levin's universal search algorithm
- Solomonoff induction principles

## 5. Quantum-Inspired Extensions

### Superposition of Factorizations

Inspired by quantum computing's approach to factorization:
- Define a "factorization superposition state" representing all possible factorizations
- Measure difficulty by the entanglement entropy of this state
- Analyze how quantum approaches could exploit structure in S(N,K)

### Phase-Space Analysis

Map the factorization process to a phase space:
- Position: current partial factorization
- Momentum: direction of search strategies
- Hamiltonian: cost function guiding factorization

This provides:
- A geometric view of factorization trajectories
- Quantitative measures of search efficiency
- Analogies to physical systems that can inspire new algorithms

## 6. Probabilistic Programming Approach

### Generative Models for S(N,K)

Develop a probabilistic programming framework to:
- Generate samples from S(N,K) according to well-defined distributions
- Perform Bayesian inference about factorization
- Model factorization as probabilistic inference

Implementation example:
```python
def generative_model_S_N_K(N, K, X_max):
    # Sample number of factors
    m = sample_from(range(1, N+1))
    
    # Sample digit classes for each factor
    digit_classes = [sample_from(K) for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Sample primes from each digit class
    primes = [sample_prime_from_class(d) for d in digit_classes]
    
    # Compute product
    n = math.prod(primes)
    
    # Reject if too large
    if n > X_max:
        reject()
    
    return {"n": n, "factors": primes, "signature": count_by_class(primes, K)}
```

### Inference Challenges

Create problems that require probabilistic reasoning:
- Given partial factorization, infer distribution of remaining factors
- Estimate probability that a number belongs to S(N,K) without full factorization
- Perform Bayesian optimal search for factors

## 7. Game-Theoretic Framework

### Adversarial Factorization Games

Define a two-player game:
- Player A selects $n \in S(N,K)$ with a hidden factorization
- Player B makes queries to discover factors
- Player A scores based on the difficulty/time for B to factor

Variants:
- Partial information games where some digit classes are revealed
- Resource-bounded games with limited queries
- Multi-round games with adaptive difficulty

### Strategic Equilibria

Analyze:
- Optimal strategies for generating hard-to-factor numbers
- Optimal querying strategies for factorization
- Nash equilibria in factorization games

This connects to:
- Cryptographic security models
- Interactive proof systems
- Automated reasoning benchmarks

## 8. Educational Progression Model

### Cognitive Scaffolding

Develop a structured learning progression based on S(N,K):
- Map parameters (N,K) to specific cognitive skills
- Create curriculum sequences that build skills systematically
- Incorporate error analysis to identify conceptual bottlenecks

Example progression:
1. S(2,{1}): Basic multiplication/division with single-digit primes
2. S(2,{1,2}): Mixed factorization with simple trial division
3. S(3,{2}): Multi-step factorization requiring working memory
4. S(3,{1,2,3}): Strategic factorization with diverse factor sizes
5. S(4,{2,3}): Complex factorization requiring sophisticated strategies

### Metacognitive Awareness

Monitor and evaluate:
- Strategy selection and adaptation
- Self-regulation during factorization
- Transfer of skills across parameter changes

## 9. Cross-Domain Applications

### Natural Language Factorization

Extend to linguistic domains:
- Sentences as products of semantic "primes"
- Words classified by length, frequency, or semantic category
- Reasoning about composition and decomposition of meaning

### Visual Factorization

Apply to image processing:
- Visual patterns as products of simpler patterns
- Classification by visual complexity metrics
- Factorization as visual chunking and reconstruction

### Abstract Algebraic Structures

Generalize to:
- Polynomial rings with irreducible factorization
- Group decompositions into simple factors
- Tensor decompositions in multilinear algebra

## 10. Complexity-Theoretic Extension

### Beyond NP: Quantified Factorization Problems

Define higher complexity versions:
- $\forall\exists$-S(N,K): Does every number up to X have a factorization in S(N,K)?
- Counting-S(N,K): How many distinct factorizations in S(N,K) does n have?
- Approximation-S(N,K): Find factors that produce a product within ε of n

### Parameterized Complexity Analysis

Analyze fixed-parameter tractability:
- With N fixed, what's the complexity in terms of max(K)?
- With K fixed, what's the complexity in terms of N?
- What structural parameters make factorization easier?

This connects to:
- Circuit complexity of arithmetic functions
- Communication complexity of factorization protocols
- Space-time tradeoffs in factorization algorithms
