## Technical Overview

### Quantum-Resistant Concepts

The system implements several key quantum resistance techniques:

1. **Multi-factor Structure**
   - Traditional RSA relies on two large primes, making it vulnerable to Shor's algorithm
   - Our system uses 3-5 balanced prime factors, increasing quantum factorization complexity
   - Factor balancing ensures no single factor can be isolated using period-finding algorithms

2. **Algorithm Complexity Analysis**
   - Classical complexity: O(exp(c(log n)^(1/3)(log log n)^(2/3))) for GNFS
   - Quantum complexity: O(log^2 n log log n) for Shor's algorithm
   - Our multi-factor approach aims to introduce additional complexity beyond standard quantum algorithms

3. **Metacognitive Reasoning Layers**
   ```
   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Meta-level Reasoning (Monitoring) │
   └────────────────┬──────────────────┘
                    │

   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐

   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
   │   Object-level Math Reasoning     │
   └───────────────────────────────────┘
   ```
   Multi-layered reasoning encourages models to develop robust mathematical approaches that can adapt to complex problem structures.

## Advanced Features

### 1. Quantum-Resistant Framework

Trains models to analyze and factorize numbers that are specifically structured to resist quantum computing algorithms:

- **Multi-factor structure**: Uses numbers with multiple balanced prime factors instead of just two
  ```python
  # Sample multi-factor generation
  def _generate_quantum_resistant_number(bit_length=256, factor_count=4):
      factor_bits = bit_length // factor_count
      factors = [sympy.randprime(2**(factor_bits-1), 2**factor_bits) for _ in range(factor_count)]
      return math.prod(factors), factors
  ```

- **Quantum complexity analysis**: Teaches models to analyze the computational complexity of factorization problems from both classical and quantum perspectives
  ```
  Classical GNFS: O(exp((64/9)^(1/3) * (log N)^(1/3) * (log log N)^(2/3)))
  Quantum Shor's: O((log N)^2 * (log log N) * (log log log N))
  Quantum multi-factor (our approach): O(m * (log N/m)^2 * (log log N/m)) for m factors
  ```

- **Shor's algorithm resistance**: Focused challenges on developing intuition for structures resistant to quantum attacks
  ```
  Shor's algorithm weakness: When factors share similar structure or are close together
  Our approach: Ensure factors have distinct bit patterns and are well-separated
  ```

### 2. Advanced Cognitive Architectures

Implements multiple cognitive architecture options:

- **Hierarchical Reasoning**: Two-level system with strategic (high-level) and tactical (low-level) reasoning layers
  ```
  STRATEGIC: Given the 256-bit number, GNFS would be inefficient. The structure suggests multiple medium-sized factors.
  TACTICAL: First check divisibility by small primes under 100, then apply Pollard's rho with multiple starting points.
  ```

- **Metacognitive Systems**: Explicit tracking of reasoning strategies, monitoring progress, and reflective assessment
  ```
  [MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS] This 1024-bit number is too large for trial division or simple factorization.
  [STRATEGY SELECTION] I'll apply ECM first to find smaller factors, then use specialized methods.
  [EXECUTION] Running ECM with B1=10000...
  [MONITORING] Found one factor. The remaining number is still too large.
  [REFLECTION] ECM was partially successful. I should try Pollard's rho with different seeds next.
  ```

- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Simulates a team of specialized experts (Theorist, Algorithmist, Implementer, Critic) working collaboratively
  ```
  [THEORIST] The number's bit pattern suggests it might have special structure, possibly related to Carmichael numbers.
  [ALGORITHMIST] We should implement a combination of Pollard's rho and ECM factorization.
  [IMPLEMENTER] Running Pollard's rho with seed 42 finds factor 1763.
  [CRITIC] We should verify this factor and check for implementation errors in our calculations.
  [CONSENSUS] We've verified the factorization through multiple approaches and confirmed it's correct.
  ```

### 3. Deep Number Theory Tools

Extensive library of advanced number theory tools:

- **Advanced Primality Testing**: Different algorithms (Miller-Rabin, AKS, Fermat) with complexity analysis
  ```python
  def advanced_is_prime(n: str, method: str = "default") -> str:
      """
      Miller-Rabin: Probabilistic, O(k log^3 n) - fast but not deterministic
      AKS: Deterministic, O(log^6 n) - guaranteed but slow
      Fermat: Very fast but can be fooled by Carmichael numbers
      """
  ```

- **Sophisticated Factorization**: Multiple approaches (Trial Division, Pollard's Rho, ECM) with performance tracking
  ```python
  def advanced_factorize(n: str, method: str = "default", timeout: int = 10) -> str:
      """
      Trial division: Best for small factors, O(√n)
      Pollard's rho: Good for medium factors, expected O(√p) where p is smallest factor
      ECM: Efficient for large numbers with smaller factors, subexponential complexity
      """
  ```

- **Mathematical Properties**: Gap analysis, density studies, twin prime detection, factorization trees
  ```
  Twin prime distribution: π₂(x) ~ 2C₂∫₂ˣdt/(log t)²
  Where C₂ = 0.6601618158... is the twin prime constant
  ```

- **Theoretical Analysis**: Comprehensive number theory classification with special number detection
  ```
  Perfect numbers: σ(n) = 2n (e.g., 6, 28, 496, 8128)
  Carmichael numbers: a^(n-1) ≡ 1 (mod n) for all a coprime to n (e.g., 561, 1105)
  ```

### 4. Mathematical Exploration Capabilities

Supports open-ended mathematical investigation:

- **Conjecture Exploration**: Testing and exploring mathematical conjectures (Goldbach, Twin Prime, etc.)
  ```
  Goldbach's Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
  
  For n=100:
  100 = 3 + 97
  100 = 11 + 89
  100 = 17 + 83
  100 = 29 + 71
  100 = 41 + 59
  100 = 47 + 53
  ```

- **Proof Sketching**: Developing rigorous mathematical proof outlines
  ```
  To prove there are infinitely many primes:
  1. Assume there are finitely many primes: p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ
  2. Consider P = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ + 1
  3. P is either prime or has a prime factor not in our list
  4. Contradiction! Therefore there must be infinitely many primes
  ```

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying mathematical patterns in prime distributions and factorizations
  ```
  Analyzing consecutive gaps between primes up to 100:
  Gaps: 1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6,4,2,4,6,6,2,6,4,2,...
  Observation: After 3, all gaps are even. Consecutive gaps of the same size become more common.
  ```

- **Carmichael Number Analysis**: Special handling for pseudoprimes with unusual properties
  ```
  561 = 3 × 11 × 17 is a Carmichael number
  For any a coprime to 561: a^560 ≡ 1 (mod 561)
  This satisfies Korselt's criterion: for each prime p dividing n, p-1 divides n-1
  ```

           └── EnhancedPrimeEnv
                  └── QuantumPrimeEnv
```

Each environment class adds new capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the base `ToolEnv` interface from the verifiers framework.

## Metacognitive Framework

When the metacognitive option is enabled, the system guides the model to develop stronger mathematical reasoning through explicit tracking of:

1. **Strategy Selection**: How to choose appropriate mathematical approaches
   ```
   [STRATEGY SELECTION]
   For this 128-bit composite number, I'll consider three approaches:
   1. Trial division for small factors (efficient if factors < 10^6)
   2. Pollard's rho (effective for factors up to 10^12)
   3. Elliptic Curve Method (better for balanced multi-factor numbers)
   
   Since this is likely a quantum-resistant challenge with multiple factors,
   I'll start with trial division to find small factors, then apply ECM,
   as it can find factors of different sizes efficiently.
   ```

2. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracking solution development
   ```
   [MONITORING]
   So far I've determined:
   - The number is not divisible by small primes < 100
   - Using Pollard's rho, I found one factor: 2309
   - After division, the remaining number is 764356935610313
   - This remaining number is still too large for direct factorization
   
   Current progress: 1/? factors found
   Next step: Apply ECM to the remaining number
   ```

3. **Error Detection**: Identifying mistakes in reasoning
   ```
   [ERROR DETECTION]
   I notice an error in my calculation:
   - I claimed 764356935610313 ÷ 17231 = 44354311, but this is incorrect
   - Recalculating: 764356935610313 ÷ 17231 = 44359756.98...
   - This indicates 17231 is not actually a factor
   
   Let me verify my earlier calculation:
   764356935610313 = 1763903164323213 ÷ 2309 = 764356934310.18...
   
   There's a discrepancy. Let me recalculate the original division.
   ```

4. **Reflection**: Assessing effectiveness of approaches
   ```
   [REFLECTION]
   My initial approach using Pollard's rho was partially effective (found 1 factor),
   but became inefficient for the remaining number. Switching to ECM proved more
   successful for finding the medium-sized factors.
   
   What worked well:
   - Starting with trial division to rule out small factors
   - Using multiple algorithms adaptively based on intermediate results
   
   What could be improved:
   - Better estimation of factor sizes before algorithm selection
   - More careful calculation verification at each step
   ```

5. **Strategy Adjustment**: Adapting to mathematical challenges
   ```
   [STRATEGY ADJUSTMENT]
   Based on the success with ECM finding medium-sized factors, I'm adjusting my approach:
   
   1. Increase the ECM bounds to B1=100000 to find potentially larger factors
   2. Run multiple ECM curves in parallel with different seeds
   3. If no factors are found after 3 attempts, switch to a quadratic sieve approach
   4. Verify all factorizations with direct multiplication
   ```

## Implementation Details

### 2. Special Challenge Generation

**Quantum-resistant Number Generation**
```python
def _generate_quantum_resistant_challenges(count, max_bits):
    challenges = []
    for i in range(count):
        # Generate multiple factors instead of just two (to resist Shor's algorithm)
        num_factors = random.randint(3, 5)
        factors = []
        
        # Each factor should be large
        factor_bits = max(32, max_bits // num_factors)
        
        for _ in range(num_factors):
            factor = self._generate_prime(factor_bits)
            factors.append(factor)
        
        product = math.prod(factors)
        factor_str = " × ".join(map(str, factors))
        
        challenges.append({
            "input": f"Analyze {product} from a quantum computing perspective.",

### 3. Reasoning Pattern Analysis

The system analyzes LLM reasoning patterns during evaluation:

```python
def _analyze_reasoning_patterns(self, messages, sample):
    """Analyze reasoning patterns in the conversation."""
    for message in messages:
        if message.get("role") != "assistant":
            continue
            
        content = message.get("content", "")
        
        # Track tools used
        tool_matches = re.findall(r'<tool>.*?"name":\s*"([^"]+)"', content, re.DOTALL)
        self.current_cognitive_state["tools_used"].extend(tool_matches)
        
        # Track cognitive depth
        self.current_cognitive_state["depth"] += 1
        
        # Look for metacognitive patterns
        if re.search(r'\b(reflect|monitoring|evaluate|assessment)\b', content, re.IGNORECASE):
            self.current_cognitive_state["verification_level"] += 1
        
        # Look for strategy shifts
        strategy_patterns = {
            "brute_force": r'\b(brute force|try all|exhaustive)\b',
            "mathematical_property": r'\b(property|theorem|identity)\b',
            "algorithm_selection": r'\b(algorithm|method|approach)\b',
            # Additional pattern matching...
        }
        
        for strategy, pattern in strategy_patterns.items():
            if re.search(pattern, content, re.IGNORECASE):
                self.current_cognitive_state["strategies_attempted"].append(strategy)
```
