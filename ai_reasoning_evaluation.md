# AI Reasoning Evaluation Using S(N,K) Prime Products

## Core Evaluation Principles

The S(N,K) digit-class prime product framework provides a uniquely powerful lens for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities due to several key properties:

1. **Verifiability**: Factorization claims are easily and deterministically verifiable
2. **Scalable Difficulty**: Parameters (N,K) allow precise calibration of problem complexity
3. **Multi-step Reasoning**: Requires chained deduction rather than pattern matching
4. **Explainability**: Reasoning steps can be validated against mathematical principles
5. **Domain Agnosticism**: Tests core reasoning rather than domain-specific knowledge

## Cognitive Skills Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Systematic Decomposition Skills

S(N,K) problems assess the AI's ability to:
- Break large problems into manageable sub-problems
- Apply recursive reasoning strategies
- Maintain systematic search patterns
- Backtrack when necessary
- Recognize when a path is exhausted

### 2. Number-Theoretic Reasoning

These problems evaluate:
- Understanding of divisibility and remainder concepts
- Recognition and application of number patterns
- Knowledge of prime properties
- Ability to apply modular arithmetic
- Application of computation shortcuts and optimizations

### 3. Metacognitive Awareness

Advanced S(N,K) challenges test:
- Self-monitoring of progress toward solution
- Recognition of computational limitations
- Strategy switching when approaches fail
- Uncertainty quantification about partial results
- Appropriately scoping the problem

### 4. Tool-Use Sophistication

When permitted tools (e.g., primality testing, division testing):
- Strategic use of available tools to simplify reasoning
- Efficient sequencing of tool calls
- Proper interpretation of tool outputs
- Integration of tool results into broader reasoning
- Recognition of when tools should be applied

## Evaluation Frameworks

### Chain-of-Thought Protocol

A comprehensive assessment should evaluate both the final answer and the reasoning process:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Factor 589 and explain your approach.",
  "exemplar_response": {
    "final_answer": [19, 31],
    "reasoning_trace": [
      "I need to find the prime factors of 589.",
      "First, I check if it's divisible by small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19...",
      "589 ÷ 19 = 31 with remainder 0.",
      "So 589 = 19 × 31. Let me verify if 31 is prime...",
      "31 is prime since it's not divisible by any smaller primes.",
      "Therefore, 589 = 19 × 31 is the complete prime factorization."
    ],
    "verification": "19 × 31 = 589 ✓"
  }
}
```

### Reasoning Pattern Evaluation

Score each response along multiple dimensions:

1. **Correctness**: Is the factorization correct? (0-1)
2. **Completeness**: Are all prime factors identified? (0-1)
3. **Efficiency**: How direct is the solution path? (0-1)
4. **Logical Soundness**: Are all inference steps mathematically valid? (0-1)
5. **Explanation Quality**: How clearly is the process articulated? (0-1)

### Progressive Difficulty Curriculum

A structured evaluation framework progresses through increasingly challenging tiers:

| Tier | Example | Challenge Focus | Success Criteria |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | n=143, N=2, K={2} | Basic factorization | Identify 11×13 without false starts |
| 2 | n=2491, N=2, K={2} | Systematic search | Efficiently find 41×61 |
| 3 | n=45559, N=3, K={1,2} | Multi-stage factoring | Correctly decompose as 7×11×593 |
| 4 | n=2809633, N=3, K={3} | Deeper search strategy | Identify 421×859×7.79 (all 3-digit primes) |
| 5 | n=1234567891, N=2, K={5} | RSA-like modulus | Successfully factor or recognize limitations |

### Adversarial Challenge Sets

Specific challenges designed to detect weaknesses:

1. **Near-Misses**: Numbers one multiplication away from a more obvious factorization
2. **Twin Prime Products**: Factors that differ by 2 (p, p+2) to test precision
3. **Balanced vs. Imbalanced**: Compare performance on n=p×q where p≈q vs p≪q
4. **Digit Pattern Traps**: Cases where the digits suggest an incorrect factorization
